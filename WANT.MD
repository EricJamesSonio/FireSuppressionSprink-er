our Project is Using the fuzzy logic controller to control the fire suppression springkler.

SO WE HAVE SOME REAL LIFE inputs such as the thing sthat triggers the fire suppresion sprinkler and the output is the water that get release from the sprinkler. so inputs i dont really know about the things that triggers the fire suppresionspringkler i only know is the fire level since when its high level it wilkl trigger then if just low or mild or mdeium it wont trigger or maybe its also based on the duration of the fire that get into the sprinkler that get detects ,, u make it fuzzy logic controller to control the amount of water that get release from the sprinkler based on the fire heat level and the duration of the  that get into the sprinkler that get detects. 

then in designing, i want u to make a design of fire suppresion sprinkler just using css and html and make it responsive and make it look like a real life fire suppresion sprinkler. just a sprinller since we will be using in whole screen background is the background.jpg inside the [images] folder. so just the sprinkler and make also have an inputs for like fire heat level and like if the certain level where the sprinlkler will be triggered to that the water splashing effect when triggered also design it using html and css and make it responsive and make it look like a real life fire suppresion sprinkler when triggered it then the release of water make it moving and the level of fire heat will be the determining factor of the duration of the water splashing since if the fire heat  is too high then the water splashing will last longer before stoping so yeah!

have an user inputs for fire heat level , 

this is the fire suppresion we will be using in this project so consider in designing

1. Wet Pipe Sprinkler Systems (most common in offices, malls, homes)

Trigger: Heat from a fire.

Each sprinkler head has a fusible link or a glass bulb filled with liquid that expands when heated.

At around 155°F–165°F (68°C–74°C) (or higher depending on design), the bulb bursts or the link melts.

This releases water immediately because the pipes are already filled (“wet”).

Language to use : Python for Logics etc and htmlo,css and js for designing and some scripts
